# Web Scraping of Mars News and Mars Weather Data

This project is on web scraping and data analysis. We were given two websites about Mars to "scrape" or extract information from using automated browsing with 
Splinter and HTML. One of the websites we were given, had data on the weather in Mars from which we had to not only extract information from, but analyze the data 
by answering some questions and providing graphs as well.

I have added two Jupyter notebook files on this repository. One of these files contains the code for the scraping of the Mars news titles and preview text.
The second Jupyter notebook file contains the code that scrapes the Mars weather data and cleans, visualizes, and analyzes that data. I have also included 
the csv file called Mission to Mars that we had to create after scraping and analyzing the Mars weather data. This csv file is in the Resources folder.
